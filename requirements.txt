## Model for Energy Equity and Climate Compatibility (MEECC_V.1)

This is an interactive dashboard built using Dash (Plotly) to explore energy and emissions projections for countries under different development and climate scenarios.

## What does this Dashboard do

- Groups countries into clusters based on energy, economic, health, education, infrastructure, and Emissions indicators.
- Allows selection of different scenarios:
  - GDP growth
  - Energy thresholds
  - Carbon budget allocation
  - Temparature targets (e.g., 1.5°C, 2°C)
- Projects key indicators:
  - Primary and final energy use
  - CO2 emissions (with and without mitigation)
  - Per capita metrics and energy/emission intensities
